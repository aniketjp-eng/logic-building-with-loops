# Logic Building with Loops
A dedicated place where i will be exploring,experimenting and documenting my Logic Building using just loops.I will be using Java language here!!

## 🧠 Phases
1. While Loop
2. Do-While Loop
3. For Loop
4. Nested Loop Logic
5. Break / Continue
6. Mathematical Series
7. Mixed Logical Loop Problems
8. Star Pattern Printing

## 🛠 Language
Java

## 📌 Methodology
- Phase-wise problem solving
- Daily incremental commits from VS Code
- Each problem includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Approach
  - Dry run
  - Time & Space Complexity

## 🚀 Target
125+ logic-building problems
